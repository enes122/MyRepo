# 🍕 Frontend Learning Projects

Hey there!  
I'm **Enes**, an aspiring frontend developer on a journey to master the magical world of the web. This repository contains some of the projects I'm building as I learn the basics of frontend development. Think of it as my little digital playground!

## 🎯 Goal

Right now, I'm focusing on building a strong foundation in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. My goal is to get comfortable with core concepts and gradually move into modern frameworks like **React** in the future.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Basic Git & GitHub for version control

## ✍️ Notes

These projects are often inspired by platforms like **Frontend Mentor**, where I try to recreate designs and layouts to sharpen my skills. The goal isn't perfection — it's progress. Step by step.
